The subscription below is the simplest case that reproduces this behavior for me.

subscription {
  recursive {
    node {
      id
    }
  }
}

You can run this mutation along the above subscription in the playground to see this issue.

mutation {
  createRecursive(
    data: { name: "Test 123", children: { create: [{ name: "Test 321" }] } }
  ) {
    id
  }
}

This demonstrates that types referencing types with recursive relationships also do not fire.

subscription {
  a {
    node {
      id
    }
  }
}

You can run this mutation along the above subscription in the playground to see this issue.

mutation {
  createA(data: {
    recursives: {
      create: {
        name: "Test 1"
        children: {
          create: [
            {
              name: "Test 2"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }) {
    id
    recursives {
      id
      name
      children {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
